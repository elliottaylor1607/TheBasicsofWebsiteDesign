			<p> JavaScript is referred to as a scripting language which is used to provide interactive functionality within websites. </br> </br> <!-- Start of paragraph div and inserting two line breaks to break up text -->
				Interactive features implemented using this language take the form of client-side scripts which are executed on the user's end within their web browsers, with examples of these features being buttons which can perform different functions such as displaying the date and time as text, conducting mathematical calculations and validating information within validation forms; these are declared within open and closed "script" tags within HTML webpage documents. </br> </br> <!-- inserting two line breaks to break up text -->
				Like most languages, JavaScript allows users to implement both pre-defined and user-defined "functions" to fulfill a specific purpose in regards to interractive features in addition to "variables" which can be used to store data, "if" statements where users specify conditions within which they wish specific tasks to be carried out, "loops" which can be used to ensure that a specific action is carried out repeatedly within specified parameters in addition to a multitude of others. </br> </br> <!-- inserting two line breaks to break up text -->     
				Due to the ways in which users can interact with features, JavaScript is also referred to as an "object-oriented" language since "functions" behave the same way as they do within other programming languages and the principal is mostly the same. </br> </br> </br> <!-- inserting three line breaks to break up text -->
				Provided below is an example of a Javascript" feature represented as a validation form which uses a function entitled "myFunction" that will allow users to interract with different fields of information, with these being represented within Javascript coding as six "variables" entitled as "vname", "vsurname", "vdob", "vage", "vgender" and "vemail." </br> </br> <!-- inserting two line breaks to break up text -->
				These variables each contain the object "document.forms", with the name of the form "myform" and the "functions" "fname", "fsurname", "fdob", "femail", "fmale", "ffemale" and "fother" held as values within the "variables." </br> </br> <!-- inserting two line breaks to break up text -->
				"Fname", "fsurname", "fage" and "femail" are represented within the form as textbox input types, with "fdob" being represented as a "date" input type within the form as a "calendar" and "fmale", "ffemale" and "fother" being represented as "radio" button input types within the form and the "submit" button being represented as a button input type within the form. </br> </br> <!-- inserting two line breaks to break up text --> 
				These are implemented in the aforementioned input types through being referenced as HTML "input", "id" and "name" HTML "attributes" within the "paragraph" tags in which each field name is specified as "paragraph" text. </br> </br> <!-- inserting two line breaks to break up text --> 
				"If" statements are then implemented for both "vname" and "vsurname", with the conditions of each being that if the values of both "vname" and "vsurname" are left empty within the textboxes when "myfunction" is called upon selecting the "submit" button,  two alert messages will be displayed in each instance stating that a "Name must be filled out" and that a "Surname must be filled out." </br> </br> <!-- inserting two line breaks to break up text --> 
				When users have provided information within most of the fields and selected the "submit" button, the results will be concatenated and displayed as "paragraph" text by using the "document.getElementById" "method" to reference the names of the "variables" associated with each field of information; this text will be displayed within a "div" entitled "dresults" between the end of the form and the webpage's footer. </br> </br> <!-- inserting two line breaks to break up text -->
				The "dresults" "div" will present informaton stating your full name, gender, age, date of birth and email address.
