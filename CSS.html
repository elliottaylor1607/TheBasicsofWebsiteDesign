			<p> CSS refers to "Cascading Style Sheet." </br> </br> <!-- Start of paragraph div and inserting two line breaks to break up text -->
				It's a type of language within website design which allows users to personalise the content of webpages through the use of coding which describes the way in which elements such as text and images are to be displayed. </br> </br> <!-- inserting two line breaks to break up text -->
				CSS uses lines of coding known as "selectors", these are what's used to select HTML "elements" that users wish to customise such as "classes" contained within style sheets. </br> </br> <!-- inserting two line breaks to break up text -->   
				This language can be referenced within webpage documents in three different ways; the first of which is "Inline" within a webpage document where content is described and customised on the same lines as the "elements" which are to be customised, with the name of the "id" "attribute" of the "element" referenced within the "style" "selector." </br> </br> <!-- inserting two line breaks to break up text -->
				The second of which is "Internally" where content is described and customised within open and closed "style" tags of webpage documents; this can only be done if the "style" tags are declared between the open and closed "body" tags of a document since this is typically where most "body" content is included on a website. </br> </br> <!-- inserting two line breaks to break up text -->
				The third of which is "Externally" within a seperate document created within a text editor application which is referenced by its name and folder location within the webpage document; this document consists of numerous "style" "selectors" which are then referenced within the webpage documents that the style sheet is attached to.

			<p id="para1"="text-align: center;"> In the example represented above-left, "Inline" CSS coding is used on the "Heading 1" text "CosmoFarmer 2.0", where the "h1" selector is used to select the "h1" "id" "attribute" along with the HTML "style" "attribute" which is assigned the value of the font "color" red.
