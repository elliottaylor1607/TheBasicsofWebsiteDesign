		<h2> The Box Model: <!-- Start of h2 div -->

			<p> The Box Model is referred to as the method in which HTML "elements" are composited together within web browsers to form website structures, with style "properties" typically being used which are referenced within CSS coding to personalise the content. </br> </br> <!-- Start of paragraph div and inserting two line breaks to break up text -->
				The first "property" that forms the outer layer of the Box Model are "margins", these refer to the spaces which surround the "padding" and main "content" that contain HTML "elements" such as text and images, with there being four different "properties" which allow users to specify "content" held within this layer of the Box Model, these being: </br> </br> <!-- inserting two line breaks to break up text -->
				Margin-top - this specifies the top margin of an "element." </br> </br> <!-- inserting two line breaks to break up text -->
				Margin-bottom - this specifies the bottom margin of an "element." </br> </br> <!-- inserting two line breaks to break up text --> 
				Margin-left - this specifies the left margin of an "element." </br> </br> <!-- inserting two line breaks to break up text -->
				Margin-right - this specifies the right margin of an "element." </br> </br> </br> <!-- inserting three line breaks to break up text -->
				The second property that forms part of the outer layer which surrounds all the content held within the Box Model are "borders", these refer to the way in which the "padding" and main "content" are surrounded, with there being four different "properties" which allow users to specify "content" held within this layer of the Box Model, these being: </br> </br> <!-- inserting two line breaks to break up text -->    
				Border-top - this specifies whether the "border" which surrounds the "padding" and "content" should have a border-top or not. </br> </br> <!-- inserting two line breaks to break up text -->  
				Border-bottom - this specifies whether the "border" which surrounds the "padding" and "content" should have a border-bottom or not. </br> </br> <!-- inserting two line breaks to break up text -->
				Border-left - this specifies whether the "border" which surrounds the "padding" and "content" should have a border-left or not. </br> </br> <!-- inserting two line breaks to break up text --> 
				Border-right - this specifies whether the "border" which surrounds the "padding" and "content" should have a border-right or not. </br> </br> </br> <!-- inserting three line breaks to break up text -->
				The third property that forms part of the inner layer which surrounds all the content held within the Box Model is "padding", this refers to the space between each "element" held within the main "content" of the webpage, with there being four different "properties" which allow users to specify "content" held within this layer of the Box Model, these being: </br> </br> <!-- inserting two line breaks to break up text --> 
				Padding-top - this specifies the space surrounding the top of an "element." </br> </br> <!-- inserting two line breaks to break up text -->
				Padding-bottom - this specifies the space surrounding the bottom of an "element." </br> </br> <!-- inserting two line breaks to break up text -->
				Padding-left - this specifies the space surrounding the left side of an "element." </br> </br> <!-- inserting two line breaks to break up text -->
				Padding-right - this specifies the space surrounding the right side of an "element." </br> </br> </br> <!-- inserting three line breaks to break up text -->
				The fourth "property" that forms the inner layer of the Box Model is the "content", this refers to "elements" such as text and images which are surrounded by "margins", "borders" and "padding" and form the main information held within the webpage, with there being twelve different "properties" which allow users to specify "content" held within this layer of the Box Model, these being: </br> </br> <!-- inserting two line breaks to break up text -->
				Normal - this specifies the "content" as being set to a "default" value, if the "content" is stated as such, it'll hold a value of "none" meaning nothing. </br> </br> <!-- inserting two line breaks to break up text --> 
				None - this specifies the "content" as being set to nothing. </br> </br> <!-- inserting two line breaks to break up text -->
				Counter - this speficies the value of the "content" as being a counter if the user has specified any JavScript coding they wish to be used as "content", with examples being "functions" and "variables." </br> </br> <!-- inserting two line breaks to break up text -->
				Attr(attribute) - this specifies the "content" as a "selector's" "attribute." </br> </br> <!-- inserting two line breaks to break up text --> 
				String - this specifies the "content" as text determined by the user. </br> </br> <!-- inserting two line breaks to break up text -->
				Open-quote - this specifies the "content" as text within an open quotation mark. </br> </br> <!-- inserting two line breaks to break up text -->
				Close-quote - this specifies the "content" as text within an closed quotation mark. </br> </br> <!-- inserting two line breaks to break up text -->
				No-open-quote - this removes any open quotation mark if specified from "content." </br> </br> <!-- inserting two line breaks to break up text -->
				No-close-quote - this removes any close quotation mark if specified from "content." </br> </br> <!-- inserting two line breaks to break up text -->    
				URL - this specifies the "content" as a type of media, examples of these being images, audio recordings and videos. </br> </br> <!-- inserting two line breaks to break up text -->
				Initial - this restores the "content" property to its "normal" value. </br> </br> <!-- inserting two line breaks to break up text -->
				Inherit - this sets the "content" "property" to inherit from a "parent" "content" "property." </br> </br> </br> <!-- inserting three line breaks to break up text --> 
				Other "properties" which can be used to customise "content" within the Box Model include the "width" and "height" properties which can be used to specify the dimensions within the "content" inside the "margins", "borders" and "padding" of elements, with there being five different "properties" which allow users to specify dimensions, these being: </br> </br> <!-- inserting two line breaks to break up text -->
				Auto - this allows the web browser the webpage is being viewed within to automatically calculate the width and the height. </br> </br> <!-- inserting two line breaks to break up text -->
				Length - this allows users to sepecify the dimensions for "width and "height" using different measurements, these include "pixels/px" and "cm." </br> </br> <!-- inserting two line breaks to break up text -->
				% - this allows users to specify the "width" and "height" "properties" of something based on the percentage of space in which they wish for it to take. </br> </br> <!-- inserting two line breaks to break up text -->
				Initial - this restores the "width" and "height" "properties" of something to its "normal" value. </br> </br> <!-- inserting two line breaks to break up text -->  
				Inherit - this sets the "width" and "height" "properties" of something to be inherited from a "parent" "div's" "content" "property."
