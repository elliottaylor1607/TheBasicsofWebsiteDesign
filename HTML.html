			<p> HTML refers to "HyperText Transfer Protocol." </br> </br>  <!-- Start of paragraph div and inserting two line breaks to break up text -->  
				It is one of the most universally renowned languages available which can be used to create documents in the form of webpages for interaction within web browsers such as "Google Chrome", "Mozilla Firefox", "Internet Explorer", "Opera" and "Safari." </br> </br> <!-- Inserting line breaks to break up the text -->
				Documents of this nature can be created within text editors within which users create their websites by inputting lines of coding between open and closed tags; open tags are referred to as "start" tags where the name of the "element" is entered, whereas closed tags are referred to as "end" tags which are where the content ends; these tags are represented as <>. </br> </br> <!-- Inserting line breaks to break up the text -->
				Before this can be achieved, documents created within text editors need to feature the text "!DOCTYPE html" within tags to specify the document type in addition to an open "html" tag and an open "head" tag, once these have been included users can begin to input HTML coding. </br> </br> <!-- Inserting line breaks to break up the text --> 
				Within "elements", users can control how content is displayed and customised by specifying "attributes" such as "font-color" and "font-size" for text in addition to "width" and "height" attributes for images and "divs." </br> </br> <!-- Inserting line breaks to break up the text --> 
				HTML coding is one of the most important features of a website since this language is what is implemented within a website's design to form the basic structure which the site will be built around and where the content will be held within, without this it wouldn't be as effective.

						The "title" text is represented within "title" tags which display the content held within the tags in the form of a "title" in a similar way to any text held as content within "headings" tags, with the difference being that this tag sets any text at a default size whereas with "headings" tags users can choose from up to six different sizes. </br> <!-- Inserting a line break to break up paragraph1 text -->  
						The "paragraph" text is represented within "paragrah" tags which display the content held within the tags in the form of a "paragraph", the noticeable difference between this and the "title" tag is that the text is noticeably smaller to represent the size in which text would typically be represented as paragraphs.
